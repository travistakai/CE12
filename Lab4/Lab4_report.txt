The construction of the ALU requires that the initial memory locations be written to by either the ALU's output or the keypad input.
Memory is then written a value to, and reflects so with a set of LED's attached to their sr latches.
Next, Latch A and Latch B are then able to read values from memory using the write enable switches.
Once they are filled, they perform an operation depending on the opcode specified.
Finally, the ALU's output can be stored back in a memory location or are overwritten when doing another operation.
All latches have select lines as well as the muxs in order to only perform the specified operation.
All latches are equipped with reset logic as well.

The overflow detection is created by checking if the MSB's are both being used or are not being used. 
If they are, the signal is ANDed with the final carryout.
If not, the signal is ANDed with the 3rd carryout as to check if the sign has changed from positive to negative.
