Input:
-Initially takes input through GETC and then proceeds to add/subtract specific amounts to check for 'LF', 'X', and '-'
-Moves on if number is valid and stores in a memory location to then retrieve later
-If character inputted is 'X' then it quits
-If character inputted is 'LF' then move along to conversion phase
-User is prompted with initial set of instructions

Addition/Multiplication:
-Stores number given assuming it isn't a special character in memory
-As the number of digits increase it takes the previous total and multiplies by 10 and adds the new number to it
-The total is then reinserted into memory for the next possible number

Conversion:
-If flag is 1, then NOT the stored total and ADD 1, then re-insert total into memory
-If no flag, proceed to compare each mask with the given total
-Print out either a 1 or a 0 to indicate if the number contains the corresponding bit
-Once it is all done, return back to the initial input stage
