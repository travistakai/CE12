Part A
Truth Table:
D CLK Res| Q Q'
0  0   0 | 0 1
0  0   1 | 0 1
0  1   0 | 0 1
1  0   0 | 0 1
0  1   1 | 0 1
1  0   1 | 0 1
1  1   0 | 1 0
1  1   1 | 0 1

Part B:
-I use a switch to delineate which address I am writing to and using the Clock to enable the writing.
-All reading/writing is controlled by the clock functionality
-Reset enables reset as well as clock so it can adjust the numbers

Other Questions:
-The word size is 4 bits
-Address space is 2^1 or 2
-Addressability is 4 bits
-Data moves from the input hex keypad to the first d latches which store the users input. Then, they move to the 2x4 registers if the right combination of write/address are given.
Once the user selects read and clock, the stored input is transmitted to the final output on the 7 segment display. All of this is through combinations of read/write, address, and clock.
